# AutomateWoo Custom Trigger - Runs Daily

Extends the functionality of AutomateWoo with a custom trigger which runs daily. 

## Usage

This operates similar to the "Customer Win Back" trigger, in that it will simply trigger once per day, at midnight. Since there is no order, subscription or customer associated with this, only shopwide rules and actions can be used with it.

## Support

This plugin is provided without any support or guarantees of functionality. If you'd like to contribute, feel free to open a PR on this repo. If you have a request, please open an issue.

> [!WARNING]  
> Please test thoroughly before deploying to a production site.
